#
# Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
#
# [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name} how are you doing today?"

# Best practice and clever solution:
#
# def greet(name):
#     return f'Hello, {name} how are you doing today?'
