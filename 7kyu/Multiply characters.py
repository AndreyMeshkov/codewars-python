# Here we have a function that help us spam our hearty laughter. But is not working! I need you to find out why...
#
# Expected results:
#
# spam(1)  ==> "hue"
# spam(6)  ==> "huehuehuehuehuehue"
# spam(14) ==> "huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue"

# fix this code!
def spam(number):
    return 'hue' * number

# Best practice and clever solution:
#
# #fix this code!
# def spam(number):
#     return 'hue' * number
